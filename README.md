# Airline_Safety_And_Statistics_Presentation/Blogpost
My Presentation on  Aviation Safety & Statistics is  composed of 5 slides which included information on airline industry basic facts, airline accident numbers throughout history, fatalities, airline vs. other transportation methods, impact of COVID-19, followed by scientifically proven research and recommendations from the Harvard University School of Public Health. My Infographics on  Aviation Safety & Statistics will help convince you how flying is the safest method of transportation.
